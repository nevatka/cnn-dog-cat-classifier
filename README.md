# cnn-dog-cat-classifier
Using Convolutional Neural Networks, this project classifies images of dogs and cats with high accuracy. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images and uses a deep learning to identify the features that distinguish dogs from cats. The code is written in Python using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.
